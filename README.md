# Titanic Dataset Labs

This repository contains labs related to the Titanic dataset. Here, we use Shiny to create web applications to interact with and visualize this dataset.

## Lab Overview

### Lab 1 - Building a Shiny User Interface

The objective of the first lab is to build a Shiny user interface (UI) for our project. This includes creating a markdown file that reproduces a given webpage and incorporating it into a Shiny app.

### Lab 2 - Importing Data, Creating a Table, and a Reactable in Shiny

In the second lab, we import the Titanic dataset, create a table, and a reactable in Shiny. The Titanic dataset is converted into a format that has one record per person. The lab demonstrates the creation of a table and a reactable in the Shiny app to interactively display this dataset.

## Usage

To use these labs, clone this repository to your local system. Then, you can open the R scripts in RStudio, run the codes, and experiment with different inputs and settings.

## Installation

To run these labs, you will need R and RStudio installed on your computer. In addition, several R packages are used in these labs. Install them using the `install.packages()` function in R. Here are the necessary packages:

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "reactable", "tidyverse", "janitor"))
```
