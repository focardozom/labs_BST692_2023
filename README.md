# Titanic Dataset Labs for shiny

This repository contains labs related to the Titanic dataset. Here, we use Shiny to create web applications to interact with and visualize this dataset.

## Lab Overview

### Lab 1 - Building a Shiny User Interface

The objective of the first lab is to build a Shiny user interface (UI) for our project. This includes creating a markdown file that reproduces a given webpage and incorporating it into a Shiny app.

### Lab 2 - Importing Data, Creating a Table, and a Reactable in Shiny

In the second lab, we import the Titanic dataset, create a table, and a reactable in Shiny. The Titanic dataset is converted into a format that has one record per person. The lab demonstrates the creation of a table and a reactable in the Shiny app to interactively display this dataset.
