# Labs Shiny: Titanic Dataset

Welcome to the Labs repository, where we use the fascinating Titanic dataset to delve into a rich variety of data analysis techniques. This repository includes step-by-step lab materials for mastering Shiny in the context of real-world data.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- **Lab 1:** An introduction to creating a User Interface using the shiny::UI in R. This lab focuses on basic aspects of UI design and deployment.
- **Lab 2:** This lab guides you on how to import data, create a table, and establish reactable objects in Shiny. It uses the Titanic dataset to demonstrate these techniques.
- **Lab 3:** Here, we explore adding reactivity to your Shiny app, allowing user interaction to control aspects of data visualization and manipulation.
- **Lab 4:** Lab 4 extends upon previous lessons by integrating reactive objects, creating visualizations, and building predictive models.
- **Lab 5:** In the final lab, we apply tidymodels to perform classification tasks, teaching you how to develop predictive models with the Titanic dataset.

## Getting Started

To begin, clone the repository to your local machine, or fork it to your own GitHub account.

## Requirements
